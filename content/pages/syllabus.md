This course makes use of Athena, MIT's UNIX-based computing environment. OCW does not provide access to this environment.

## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 lectures / week, 1.5 hours / lectures

## Course Description

In this course, we will concentrate on 3D, not 2D illustration or image processing. You will learn:

- Fundamentals of computer graphics algorithms
- Basics of real-time rendering and graphics hardware
- Basic OpenGL
- C++ programming experience

You will NOT learn:

- OpenGL and DirectX hacks
- Software packages
- Artistic skills
- Game design

## Prerequisites

It is useful if you have knowledge of the following:

- C++: All assignments are in C++
- Calculus, Linear Algebra: Solving equations, derivatives, integral; vectors, matrices, basis, solving systems of equations

## Assignments

- Turn in code and executable (Athena Linux).
- Always turn in a README file: Describe problems, explain partially-working code, and say how long the assignment took.
- Coding style is important: Some assignments are cumulative.
- Collaboration policy: see below.
- Late policy:
    - Â The deadline is absolute. All late assignments will be graded 0. So, submit early, even before you might be fully done.
    - Due Wednesday @ 8pm
    - Extensions only considered if requested 1 week before due date
    - Medical problems must be documented

## Collaboration Policy

- You can chat, but code on your own (we use automated plagiarism detection software!)
- Use Piazza message board
- Help others on Piazza message board (will help your grade!)
- Acknowledge your collaboration (in README)
- Talk to each other, get a community going

## Textbooks

- No textbook is required
